# SEC
A Fortran-based microbial-explicit soil carbon cycle model.

## Model Overview
SEC is a process-oriented soil carbon model that explicitly represents microbial decomposition processes using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 
The model is designed to work with land surface models like CABLE and ORCHIDEE.
